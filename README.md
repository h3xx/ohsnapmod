# Oh Snap moddded

## a bitmap font

This font was created by taking the [ohsnap](https://sourceforge.net/projects/osnapfont/) font and, using glyphs from [terminus](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/), patching the holes in the ISO8859-1 version in order to make it more complete with regard to special graphics mode.
